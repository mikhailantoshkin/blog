## About

Hello, my name is Mikhail, and I'm a Python backend software developer who also happens to be writing some Rust. 
You can find links to my socials in the bottom right corner of the page. This resume is also available in [pdf](resume.pdf).

## Experience

* ### 2019-08-14 - Present time 
    **Software Engineer at [CyberLympha](cyberlympha.com)**
    
    Starting as a junior developer after my 4th year of University, working part-time for a year, I was responsible for creating several MVPs before
    joining the main team (although quite small at the time, only 10 people, including QA and Analytics). Now I'm one 
    of the Lead Devs in the Core Team, responsible for steering architectural design of the project. Programming work I do comes in all shapes and forms:
    from fixing bugs related to SQLAlchemy on the backend to `strace`'ing said backends, investigating production outages and hunting memory leaks 
    (gladly, it does not happen that often).
    
    Though I'm not a fronted developer, but I sometimes *gently*
    coarse our Angular fronted to compile after breaking changes in the backend API.

    My responsibilities include (but not limited to):
    * Designing python (micro)services 
    * Partaking in architectural design of the project
    * Partaking in release planning
    * Refactoring of both old code and old features
    * Fixing bugs, often most notorious ones
    * Implementing new features
    * Rust evangelism
    * Mentoring of junior colleagues
    

## Education

* ### 2015 - 2021 Ural Federal University
