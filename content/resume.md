## About

Hello, my name is Mikhail and I'm a Python backend software developer who also happens to be interested in Rust. You can find links to my socials
in the bottom right corner of the page.

## Experience

* ### 2019-08-14 - Present time 
    **Software Engineer at [CyberLympha](cyberlympha.com)**
    
    Starting as a junior developer after my 4th year of University, working part time for a year, I was responsible for creating several MVPs before
    joining the main team (altho quite small at the time, only 10 people, including QA and Analytics). Now I'm one 
    of the Lead Devs in the Core Team, responsible for steering architectural design of the project. Programming work I do comes in all shapes and forms,
    from fixing bugs related to SQLAlchemy on the backend to `strace`'ing said backends, investigating production outages and hunting memory leaks 
    (though it does not happen that often).
    
    Though I'm not a fronted developer, I sometimes *gently*
    coarse our Angular fronted to compile after breaking changes in backend API.
